PWM-based BLDC motor control using Arduino and Tinkercad
# BLDC Motor PWM Speed Control (Tinkercad Simulation)

This project simulates PWM-based control of a BLDC motor using Arduino. Since BLDCs are not directly supported in Tinkercad, we simulate the effect using a potentiometer and an LED.

## 🔧 Components Used

- Arduino Uno R3  
- Potentiometer  
- LED  
- Resistor (220Ω)  

## ⚡ Circuit Diagram

LED connected to pin 9, potentiometer to A0. The PWM output changes based on pot position.

## 🔁 Code

See [BLDC_PWM.ino](./BLDC_PWM.ino)

## 💡 Future Improvements

- Real BLDC integration using simulation platforms like Proteus or MATLAB Simulink
- Feedback loop implementation
